                     Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
                <br>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
                <br>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                <br>And summer's lease hath all too short a date: 
                <br>Sometime's too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                <br>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
                <br>And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
                <br>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
                <br>But thy external summmer shall not fade,
                <br>Nor lose possesion of that fair thou ow'st,
                <br>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
                <br>When in eternal lines to the time thou grow'st,
                <br>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
                <br>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
